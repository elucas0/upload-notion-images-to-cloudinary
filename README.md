# Upload Notion Images to Cloudinary

Script to move images in Notion to Cloudinary, using the [Notion API](https://developers.notion.com/) and the [Cloudinary API](https://cloudinary.com/documentation/node_image_and_video_upload).

**‚≠êÔ∏è Contributions are welcome**. If this code can be useful to you, consider improving it and opening a pull request. There are things to be done, like:
* Handling errors more gracefully
* Supporting paginated results for large databases and pages
* Using the page title for the cover image filename
* Adding CI
* Writing tests
* Publishing to NPM

## Why is this needed?

Because a site using Next.js leveraging Static Site Generation and Image Optimization with Notion as a CMS can't have the images hosted by Notion.

The Notion API returns temporary URLs for images hosted by Notion. The URLs will expire after one hour. This breaks [Next.js Image Optimization](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/image-optimization) for Static Site Generated pages because after its internal image cache expires, it can't refetch from the URLs Notion provided at build time.

The solution to use Next.js Image Optimization and Notion as a CMS is to host images in a separate service. However, uploading images to another service and then linking them from Notion is cumbersome.

With this script, you can add images to Notion pages without worrying about where they are hosted, and then before publishing, you can execute this script to move the files to Cloudinary, where they'll have a persistent URL that Next.js can use at any time.

### Example

This technology has been used for my website, build with Next.js and Notion. [https://github.com/guillermodlpa/site](https://github.com/guillermodlpa/site)

## Usage

1. Get a Notion API token for your account at https://www.notion.so/my-integrations, creating an integration with "read content" access, "update content" access, and "no user information" capabilities.
1. Identify the ID of the Notion database that you want to go over. For that, open the database view on the browser, the URL is `https://www.notion.so/<database ID>?v=<view ID>`
1. Obtain your Cloudinary API Environment Variable.
1. Optionally, choose a folder within your Cloudinary account to upload images to. You can pass it later with `CLOUDINARY_UPLOAD_FOLDER`.
1. Enable the integration to manipulate the database, by clicking Share on its page and entering your integration name.
1. Run installation of dependencies:
    ```console
    $ npm install
    ```
1. Compile the TypeScript source code:
    ```console
    $ npm run build
    ```
1. Execute the script passing the parameters as environment variables:
    ```console
    $ NOTION_TOKEN=[your token] \
    NOTION_DATABASE_ID=[your DB ID] \
    CLOUDINARY_URL=[your api env var] \
    CLOUDINARY_UPLOAD_FOLDER=[folder to upload images to] \
    npm run start
    ```
